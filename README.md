## Assignment Summary

# Ticket Request for Horiseon

Horiseon is a company that requested assistance for their website. Problems included redundant CSS stylings, broken links, and not using semantic HTML.

# Redundant CSS

It was possible to consolidate many of the stylings. Originally each DIV had its own sytling specified despite being the same across the various, similar DIVs. This was reduced by using CLASS to link them all to one set of style specifications. For unique items, such as the images that are aligned left or right, additional classes/IDs were used.

# Broken links

Nav-bar had broken links. These were fixed by linking to those section's IDs

# Semanitic HTML

The page was comprised of DIVs rather than semantic HTML. These improvements were applied to enable easier navigation of the source for further additions/improvements/bug fixes in the future.
